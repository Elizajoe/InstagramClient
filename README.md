View Popular photos on Instagram

I have created a basic Instagram Client Viewer to View Popular Photos on Instagram.
It took me about 6 hours to complete this app.

Following are the User Stories:
1. The User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram.

2. For each photo displayed, user can see the following details:
    Require :Graphic, Caption, Username.
    Optional : Like Count and a Like Button.
    
    
Here is a gif to the app I have made:
